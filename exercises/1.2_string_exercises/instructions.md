# String Exercises

For the following excercises [this W3 Schools reference for string slicing](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings_slicing.asp) and this [Data Camp resource on strings and slicing](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/python-string-tutorial) may be helpful.

You are given the following string:
```python
myString = "You need parentheses for chemistry !"
```
## Part 1
Write a single line print statement that uses slicing to display `try`.

```python
print(myString[]) # should print 'try'
```
## Part 2
Write a single line print statement that uses slicing to display `You need`.

## Part 3
Write a single line print statement that uses slicing to display every fifth character in the string. Remember that characters include any letters, numbers, spaces, and punctuation in the string.
Hint: use the resources linked from the top of the instructions!

## Part 4
Write a single line print statement that uses slicing to display the string in reverse.

## Bonus Exercise
If you feel condifent with slicing and the `len()` function, write a section that takes any string as an input and prints only the first half of the string.

Examples:
```python
"Hello!" # prints 'Hel'
"Hello" # prints 'He'
```
