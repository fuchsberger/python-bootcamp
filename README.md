## About the workshop

- We are assuming some knowledge of Python, but will still go through each topic as a review
- As we go through examples, you should code along and practice before we break for activities
- This workshop is hybrid, so we will have people on Zoom and in person.
- For Zoom:
  - You don't need to keep your camera on during the workshop
  - Please keep yourself muted unless you have something to add (it makes it easier for everyone to hear)
  - We will do our best to repeat questions and comments from the room so that you can hear them
  - We will monitor the chat and the raise hand notifications for questions.
- In person:
  - You do not need to ask to leave the room, take an unscheduled break, or use the restroom
  - Please raise your hand for questions


## Schedule Fall 2024 - August 19 - 23

Every day from `9` - `12` an instructional session will take place where the instructor will go over various topics. Smaller activities are build in to keep students engaged. The pacing is quite fast as to ensure we can cover all important topics of CSCI 203 during that week. If you need more time to process the materials you should address it in the afternoon session on a student per student basis.

Every day from `1` - `2` there is an open session that can be used to:
- go over topics from previous sessions again (more slowly)
- go over topics submitted by students (at least 2 days in advance)
- work on smaller exercies or feedback on voluntary homework
