## About the workshop

- We are assuming some knowledge of Python, but will still go through each topic as a review

- As we go through instructional parts we do not recommend copying code into your notes unless you write down additional information that is not already written in the lecture materials. All materials are shared with the students and we feel its more productive if you use your time to absorb the knowledge rather then try and multitask by writing down notes.

- As we go through excercises, you should be engaged, and do your best to code solutions for the given problems. If you finish early use the time to practice more with the materials or read through the section again. This strategy will allow you to retain most of what you learn in the workshop.

- This workshop is fully remote.
  - The Zoom link for all our sessions is: [Zoom Link]()
  - You don't need to keep your camera on during the workshop
  - Please keep yourself muted unless you have something to add (it makes it easier for everyone to hear)
  - I may not see questions raised in the chat timely. If i ignore your question for a while its probably best to unmute and ask verbally.

## Schedule Fall 2024 - August 19 - 23

Every day from `9` - `12` an instructional session will take place where the instructor will go over various topics. Smaller activities are build in to keep students engaged. The pacing is quite fast as to ensure we can cover all important topics of CSCI 203 during that week. If you need more time to process the materials you should address it in the afternoon session on a student per student basis.

Every day from `1` - `2` there can be an optional to:
- go over topics from previous sessions again (more slowly)
- go over topics submitted by students (at least 2 days in advance)
- work on smaller exercies and projects or feedback on voluntary homework
- To have the instructor present during that time you should let me know by the end of the morning session.
